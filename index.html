      <h2>Driving To School</h2>
      My inspiration for this poem is comes from getting stuck in traffic on my
      way to school.
      <div class="haiku">
        <br />
        School driving is hard.<br />
        It is always really slow.<br />
        Take the train next time.<br />

      <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
      <p>
        I believe my personal interests, climbing, running, and coding, are
        quite unique. Climbing is extremely important to me. I always climb at
        the Momentum climbing gym in Lehi. The reason I enjoy climbing so much
        is because it keeps me strong and it gives me an awesome community of
        people to interact with on a daily basis. Rock climbing is one of my
        favorite things to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another one of my personal interests is running. I love running because
        it forces me to do something physical that generally isn't too
        comfortable. Not only does this keep my cardio in relatively good shape,
        it also helps me to improve my self discipline in a healthy way.
      </p>
      <p>
        My last, but certainly not least, interest is coding. This, indeed, is
        why I am a computer science major at UVU. I am also a front-end engineer
        for a fiber installation company. I love coding because it is a creative
        outlet for me. Another perk of coding is that it allows me to make a lot
        of money. While I do not believe that most computer programmers are into
        fitness like me, I believe that it is the perfect mesh of
        interest-genere's for me.
